Q/A:

Q: Is this software legal?
A: Yes, it is legal to use as long as you do not claim the assets as your own or use them for your own profit.

Q: Can I copy the code of 'DDMT.py'?
A: Sure! I am totally okay with you distributing my program through your own repositories. It's okay as long as you do not sell it/use it for commercial use.

Q: What can I extract with this tool?
A: You can extract .rpa files (Ren'Py archives, these files are used to compress Ren'Py game assets.). These files can contain the code of the game, the images and sprites of the game, the sound tracks and sound effects of the game and etc. I am thinking to add a memory editor next.

Q: There are certain bugs in this tool!
A: I know, this tool was made in the span of 2 days. I will try to fix the annoying bugs such as the folder-with-a-space bug with the next release.
